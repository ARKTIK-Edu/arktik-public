# ARKTIK — Press Kit (Public)
Version: v0.1
Last updated: 2025-12-17

## 1) One-line description
ARKTIK is a family-first, evidence-first ecosystem that delivers textbook-powered education and governed publishing—so students graduate with documented capability and credible public voice.

## 2) What ARKTIK includes
- **ARKTIK Education**: a stability-first, textbook-powered learning system with audit-ready outputs and portfolio outcomes.
- **ARKTIK Press**: publishing and rights packaging with edition control and commercial licensing/whitelabel pathways.
- **ARKTIK News & Media**: distribution built on corrections/versioning discipline and verifiable authenticity.
- **ARKTIK Lifestyle**: real-world belonging (events and enrichment) that anchors community offline.

## 3) Positioning statement (parent and institution safe)
ARKTIK provides a healthy alternative for teen expression: small cohorts, real mentors, and editorial standards that turn raw ideas into sharp, precise work people actually want to read and watch. This is conversation and belonging with guardrails—built to protect minors and produce outcomes.

## 4) Child protection posture (non-negotiable)
ARKTIK is family-first and respects the global rights of parents/guardians.
We operate a **zero-tolerance posture for sexualized speech/content**. This is not a social network.
See: `../CHILD_PROTECTION_STANDARD.md`.

## 5) Integrity: corrections, versioning, and authenticity
ARKTIK maintains a publication posture where:
- canonical sources matter
- corrections/version history are controlled and visible (where applicable)
- ARKTIK may publish verification artifacts (manifests) for qualifying releases

See:
- `../PROVENANCE.md`
- `../MANIFEST_SPEC.md`
- `../MEDIA_RIGHTS.md`

## 6) What makes ARKTIK different (short bullets)
- The textbook is the engine: predictable architecture that produces repeatable outputs.
- Rigor that shows: portfolios, artifacts, and mastery documentation—not bare minimums.
- Publishing with discipline: evidence-first prompts, editorial review, and correction posture.
- Belonging without engagement loops: closed cohorts, guided discussion, and outcomes.

## 7) Press guidance (how to cover ARKTIK accurately)
- Use approved boilerplate from `boilerplate.md`.
- Attribute ARKTIK clearly and link to canonical ARKTIK sources where available.
- Do not imply accreditation or partnerships unless ARKTIK has published them.
- Do not publish personal data, identify minors, or infer student identities.

## 8) Media requests / permissions
Requests for interviews, assets, syndication, or deeper release packets should be routed through arktikeducation.org.
