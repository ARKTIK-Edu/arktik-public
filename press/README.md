# Press (Public) — ARKTIK

This folder contains **press-safe, partner-safe materials** designed to help journalists, producers, and qualified collaborators cover ARKTIK accurately and verify authenticity without exposing internal systems or student data.

ARKTIK is a proprietary ecosystem. This repository is published for **controlled distribution and evaluation**. It is not open source.

## What ARKTIK Is
ARKTIK is a governed ecosystem that includes:
- **ARKTIK Education** — a textbook-powered learning system built for stability, rigor, and portfolio outcomes  
- **ARKTIK Press** — publishing and rights packaging with edition control and licensing/whitelabel pathways  
- **ARKTIK News & Media** — distribution built on corrections/versioning discipline and verifiable provenance  
- **ARKTIK Lifestyle** — real-world belonging (events and enrichment) that anchors community offline

## What This Folder Includes
- Approved boilerplate and positioning language
- Founder bio blocks
- Key facts and media-ready descriptions
- Media contact and permission routing
- Integrity artifacts references (corrections/versioning posture, provenance protocol)

## What This Folder Does Not Include
- Internal operations, playbooks, automation designs, or tenant configurations
- Student/client PII, case details, or private submissions
- Full News & Media archives, show packages, raw footage, or complete transcripts
- Any materials requiring NDA or commercial licensing

## Editorial Integrity, Corrections, and Provenance (Important)
ARKTIK is press-friendly and collaboration-forward, but we are strict on authenticity and safety:


- **Canonical sources matter:** ARKTIK maintains official publication channels and version history.
- **Corrections/versioning discipline:** ARKTIK controls corrections, updates, retractions, and takedowns for its media outputs.
- **Provenance protocol:** ARKTIK may publish signed manifests and public verification artifacts for qualifying releases.
- **Web3 posture:** If ARKTIK uses on-chain anchoring, it is **hash-only and ARKTIK-issued**. No third party may mint, pin, anchor, or make provenance claims without written permission.
