## 4. ARKTIK Content Terms (Materials)

You may NOT, without ARKTIK’s prior written permission:
- sell, sublicense, or commercially exploit Materials;
- create derivative works of Materials (including adaptations, rewrites, translations, or repackaging) for redistribution;
- upload Materials to any “content library,” learning platform, dataset, model-training corpus, or AI system (public or private) for training, fine-tuning, embedding, or bulk indexing;
- remove ARKTIK branding, notices, edition identifiers, version marks, or correction/versioning statements;

## 5. ARKTIK News & Media Rights (All Rights Reserved)
All News & Media Content is proprietary. No rights are granted to reproduce, rebroadcast, syndicate, repackage, scrape, train on, or redistribute News & Media Content except:
- brief quotations for commentary or criticism consistent with applicable law, with attribution and a link to the canonical ARKTIK source.

ARKTIK reserves exclusive rights to:
- publish, edit, correct, version, retract, and distribute News & Media Content;

ARKTIK may revoke your rights to use any Materials immediately upon breach.

## 8. Student Safety and Identity Protection
Where Materials involve student publishing/speaking pathways:
- minors’ public identity must be protected by default (pseudonyms and opt-in release only);
