# ARKTIK Child Protection Standard (Public)
Version: v1.0
Last updated: 2025-12-17

ARKTIK is family-first and respects the global rights of parents and guardians. We operate a zero-tolerance posture for sexualized speech or content. This is not a social network. We protect children; we do not exploit them.

## 1) Non-Negotiable Rule: Zero Tolerance
Sexualized content is prohibited in any ARKTIK environment or ARKTIK-associated deliverable. This includes:
- sexual content, sexualized speech, or sexually suggestive commentary
- grooming behavior or boundary testing
- sexual jokes, innuendo, fetish content, or “coded” sexual references
- romantic/sexual attention directed toward minors
- any depiction, discussion, or implication that sexualizes a minor

There are no “artistic,” “educational,” “documentary,” “satire,” or “edgy” exceptions when minors are involved.

## 2) This Is Not a Social Network
ARKTIK is a coached publishing and speaking environment with outcomes.
We do not operate engagement loops or open social networking features for minors.

Design posture (high-level):
- Closed cohorts by default
- No open DMs for minors
- Mentor-mediated communication (where applicable)
- Adult-led editorial review for any public-facing publication
- Pseudonym-first public posture for minors
- Corrections/versioning discipline for published materials

## 3) Parent/Guardian Rights and Consent
Minors participate only with parent/guardian permission and consent terms that clearly state:
- what is collected, why, and for how long
- what may be published publicly (if anything)
- whether a pseudonym or real name is used (real name requires explicit opt-in)
- how removal, retraction, and corrections work

## 4) Enforcement
Violations trigger immediate action:
- immediate removal of content
- immediate suspension or permanent removal from ARKTIK environments
- parent/guardian notification when a minor is involved
- escalation to ARKTIK Safety Officer and, where required, reporting to appropriate authorities

## 5) Alignment and Association
Any “ARKTIK-Aligned” or “ARKTIK-Associated” status requires adherence to this standard as a condition of participation. ARKTIK may revoke association and publicly disassociate at its discretion for breach.

## 6) Integrity and Dignity
ARKTIK maintains a Civic Dignity Standard: no harassment, no doxxing, and no content that targets or degrades people for immutable characteristics. Child protection is a hard boundary within that standard.
