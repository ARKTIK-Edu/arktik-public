# ARKTIK Public Downloads

This folder contains **public-safe ARKTIK downloads** intended for parents, educators, partners, and media. These assets are designed to be shared freely and used as “value tokens” during outreach.

## What belongs here
- Public-facing PDFs and one-pagers (parent-safe, partner-safe)
- Sample “look inside” pages that demonstrate the ARKTIK Textbook Engine
- Press-safe collateral that does **not** expose internal operations, client/student data, or partner-sensitive details

## What must NOT be placed here
- Any student/parent PII (names, emails, phone numbers, addresses, case details)
- Operational playbooks (Power Automate design, SharePoint schemas, moderation queues)
- Internal pricing sheets, internal SOPs, sales scripts, referral payout mechanics
- Any content that implies accreditation, legal advice, or uncontracted partnerships
