# ARKTIK (Public) — Controlled Distribution Vault

This repository contains **public-safe ARKTIK materials** published for evaluation, press, and controlled distribution. ARKTIK is a **proprietary ecosystem**. We are not open source.

ARKTIK exists to deliver a stability-first, evidence-first learning and publishing system—built to protect students, families, institutions, and outcomes.

## What’s Here
- **Downloads**: parent-safe, partner-safe one-pagers and PDFs for outreach and evaluation  
- **Press & Brand**: approved boilerplate, media kit components, and usage guidance  
- **Site Copy Blocks**: public-facing copy fragments for approved ARKTIK web surfaces (as applicable)

## What’s Not Here
- Operational playbooks, internal workflows, automation designs, tenant configurations, or pipeline schemas  
- Any student or client data (PII)  
- “Community build” surfaces (we do not accept public contributions into our internal EDU M365 operating environment)

## Rights and Use
All content in this repository is governed by the **ARKTIK Proprietary Public License (APPL)**. In plain terms:
- You may **review** and **share unmodified** materials for non-commercial informational use with attribution.
- You may **not** commercialize, modify, rehost at scale, scrape, train AI systems on, or perform any on-chain/Web3 actions with ARKTIK content.

## Licensing and Whitelabel (ARKTIK Press)
ARKTIK offers **commercial licensing** and **white-label packaging** through **ARKTIK Press** for qualified organizations and programs. Typical engagements include:

- branded program packaging (white-label) with governance requirements  
- distribution and syndication arrangements for approved media properties  
- institutional pilots (schools, courts, nonprofits, community programs)  

Commercial rights require a separate written agreement.

## Partnership Posture (Important)
We welcome serious collaboration conversations at the business level; however:
- We do **not** operate an open-source or public contributor model.
- We do **not** provide external technical collaboration into ARKTIK’s closed EDU M365 environment.
- Any operational integration occurs only under a formal agreement and scoped delivery.
